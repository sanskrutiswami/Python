What are modules in Python?
>> A python module is a .py file which contains
   built-in-functions, classes, and variables. 
>> Every module is built to carry out a specfic task.
>> We can use modules created by others in our code. 
>> There are two types of modules in python :
   1. Built-in modules : These modules are already available 
   for use that come along with the python programming language.
   There is no need to externally install these modules.
   2. External Modules : On the other hand, modules created
   by other software devlopers, which are not built-in,
   are called as External modules. These are intstalled with
   the help of pip.

What is REPL?

>> It is an interactive language shell
   which is a computer programming environment
   that takes single user inputs and executes them.
